  "Description": "Now you’re getting the hang of it! Now let’s see how far the rabbit hole goes. Pattern literal matching isn’t much different than just matching of strings to your the patterns you’ve written already. In this sense, regex isn’t that interesting. Here’s where the magic happens. Regex has this concept of metacharacters, where certain characters will match large swaths of other characters. Case and point, the infamous dot, i.e. ‘.’ (pun intended). Or as Regexcellence team member Lucy puts it, the DOT! The dot character is essentially a wild card, and will match anything. Armed with this knowledge, see if you can pass the next exercise! In most implementations of Regular Expressions, this holds true, but Javascript’ s regex engine does not match the dot character to line breaks.Fortunately, on Regexcellence, we use an excellent regex transpiler called XRegExp, that supports line break matching.See more about this feature HERE.",

So the sooner you get used to the function of the backslash the better! Typically the use of the backslash is either used to escape a metacharacter to represent it literally, or to escape an otherwise literal character to make it meta.

  "description": "Well done! Now that you’re getting used to the basics we can get a little fancier. The hyphen is a wonderful tool for creating a concise way of matching to many different characters. Instead of writing /[abcdefg]/, we can simply write /[a-g]/. This also works for digits, for example writing /[0-9]/ is a great way to match to any number. But wait! There’s an even better way to match numbers. You can use metacharacters to match specific classes of characters. The \\d metacharacter is used to match only numbers and is equivalent to /[0-9]/. Matching to a certain number of character repetitions is as easy as following the character with some curly braces. /a{1}/ will match to a string containing one ‘a’, while /a{1,}/ will match a string as long as it has at least one ‘a’, but could contain one hundred ‘a’s. If you would like to match various strings that range in 'a'-length, create a limit. /a{2,5}/ will match strings with two to five continuous ‘a’s. Try to use curly brackets and the metacharacter to validate and match the 5-digit zip codes!",

Using the caret character without square brackets will guarantee that the regular expression only matches to lines that begin with the given string. For example we want to validate that a url is on a secured protocol. To do so we want to make sure that the url starts with 'https://' by using the pattern /^https:\\/\\// Additionally it is also possible to match lines that end with specific characters or words. You can do that using the dollar sign ($). Give it a whirl! Try to match only the words that end with 'en'.",
