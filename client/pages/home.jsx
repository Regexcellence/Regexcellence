            Regular Expressions have been around since the 50s, but it wasnâ€™t until the 80s that the regex we know and love today really started to develop. A lot of the patterns and syntax was designed specifically to work with Perl, and you will still sometimes hear the term Perl-style thrown around. Luckily regex works well with a myriad of languages today, and honing your skills will help you become an all-around phenomenal programer!
